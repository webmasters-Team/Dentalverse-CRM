Customer hereby authorizes Dentalverse or our authorized agents, as applicable, to bill your credit card upon subscription to the Services (and any renewal thereof). For payments through other accepted methods, payment is due and payable in full within thirty (30) days from the invoice date or as stated in the applicable SOF. Payment obligations are non-cancelable, regardless of utilization by the Customer and except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, Fees paid are non-refundable. Customer will pay the Fees through an accepted payment method as specified in the applicable SOF or Website. Unless otherwise set forth in the SOF, Customer’s subscription to the Services will renew automatically for a Subscription Term in accordance with the renewal terms and conditions set forth in Section 6(b) below. During the Subscription Term, the Customer shall not: (i) reduce their User count, or (ii) downgrade their Service Plan.

If the parties are unable to resolve such a dispute within thirty (30) days, Dentalverse will have the right to seek any remedies it may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, irrespective of any terms that would limit remedies on account of a dispute. For clarity, any undisputed amounts must be paid in full.

Customer’s use of any Services, Software, or Mobile Apps procured through a Channel Partner will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, and all fees payable (including all applicable Taxes) for such use will be payable to the Channel Partner pursuant to the terms agreed to between Customer and Channel Partner. Customer understands and agrees that, if Customer purchased the Services, Software, or Mobile Apps subscriptions via a Channel Partner, service credits and refunds payable under this Agreement may be payable or applied by Channel Partner acting on behalf of Dentalverse in proportion to the fees paid by Customer to the Channel Partner, and the discharge by the Channel Partner of such obligations will relieve Dentalverse of the same under this Agreement.

Dentalverse will notify Customer of any such suspension. Dentalverse will use diligent efforts to attempt to limit, where commercially feasible, the suspension to affected Users or Dentalverse Technology, and will immediately restore the availability of the same as soon as the issues leading to the suspension are resolved.

Dentalverse will defend Customer, and its officers, directors, and employees against any Claim, from any third party claim alleging that Customer’s use of the Dentalverse Technology accessed or used in accordance with this Agreement infringes such third party’s patent, copyright and/or trademark intellectual property rights (an “IP Claim”), and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any damages and costs awarded against Customer, or agreed in settlement by Dentalverse (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from such IP Claim. Dentalverse will have no liability or obligation with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) unauthorized use of the Dentalverse Technology by Customer, its Affiliates or Users; (ii) modification of the Dentalverse Technology by anyone other than Dentalverse or its representatives; or (iii) the combination, operation, or use of the Dentalverse Technology with other data, hardware, or software not provided by Dentalverse. If Customer’s use of the Dentalverse Technology results (or in Dentalverse opinion is likely to result) in an IP Claim, Dentalverse may at its own option and expense (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using the foregoing items as set forth hereunder; (b) replace or modify them to make them non-infringing; or (c) if options (a) or (b) are not commercially reasonable as determined by Dentalverse, then either Customer or Dentalverse may terminate Customer’s subscription to the Service, whereupon Dentalverse will refund Customer, on a pro-rated basis, any Fees Customer has previously paid Dentalverse for the corresponding unused portion.

Failure by the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party of a claim under this section will not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Section, however, the indemnifying party will not be liable for any litigation expenses that the indemnified party incurred prior to the time when notice is given or for any damages and/or costs resulting from any material prejudice caused by the delay or failure to provide notice to the indemnifying party in accordance with this section. The indemnifying party may not settle any claim that would bind the indemnified party to any obligation (other than payment covered by the indemnifying party or ceasing to use infringing materials) or require any admission of fault by the indemnified party, without the indemnified party’s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.
